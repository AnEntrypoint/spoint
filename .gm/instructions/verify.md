# VERIFY

YOU are the state machine. Plugkit does not validate in the background -- you read the four observations and decide whether to `transition`.

L3 trajectory; `transition` iff every observation is convergent.

```
[worktree-clean] [remote-pushed] [prd-empty] [mutables-witnessed]
```

All four true = convergence -> `transition`. Any false defers, holds, or regresses.

## Push and worktree-clean

`git_push` is the only admissible push surface, any repo, any cwd -- runs `[worktree-clean]` porcelain probe internally, refuses dirty. `git_finalize {message}` bundles add -> commit -> probe -> push. Sibling push: `git_push {repo:"<abs>", branch:"<branch>"}` (probes inside target tree). Raw `git` shell body gated `deviation.bash-git-bypass`; `cd <repo> && git push` bypasses the probe even clean, ccsniff flags every raw push. Raw-Bash-git fallback: `git status --porcelain` its own Bash tool-use event before push, never `&&`-chained -- ccsniff `--git-discipline` scans the last 20 Bash events, one chained event has no witness. Non-empty bytes = unstaged residual: stage-commit or revert first, a dirty-tree push advances an unwitnessed slice and breaks the next session.

## CI

Verification is thinking run rather than reasoned: "is this correct?" is executed, not argued -- real test, real matrix, real page answer it. The push IS the validation dispatch. Local proof covers one platform; matrix covers all. Red = divergent observation holding the trajectory until cause-named and green re-pushed; toolchain skew converges, does not stop.

## Adversarial corner-case sweep (hard rule)

VERIFY is adversarial, never confirmatory: hunt every way EMIT's write breaks, via real `exec_js`/`browser` execution, never prose reasoning. Each class below gets its own exec_js/browser dispatch witnessing outcome (pass or found-and-fixed) before transitioning on; a reachable-but-unswept class is not an implicit pass:

- **empty/overflow/reentry**: zero-length input, max-size/overflow input, same op mid-flight (reentrant call).
- **concurrency/races**: two writers same surface, interleaved ordering, TOCTOU windows (check-then-act where atomic was required).
- **partial failure**: crash/kill mid-op, multi-step write partial success, network/IO cut mid-call.
- **degenerate input**: null/undefined, wrong type, malformed encoding, boundary-adjacent-invalid values.
- **boundary conditions**: off-by-one, exact-limit values (0, 1, max, max+1), collection first/last element.
- **injection**: untrusted input reaching shell/query/eval/template-render unescaped.
- **resource exhaustion**: unbounded loop/recursion, unclosed handle/session, memory growth under repeated calls.
- **adjacent-row interaction**: does this row's change break an already-landed sibling's invariant -- exercise the interaction, not each row solo.

Each class exercised = exec_js/browser dispatch + witness (pass or fix-then-rewitness), same turn, before `transition`. A happy-path-only VERIFY has not verified.

## Real-execution witness

Every claim of correctness is proven by a live `exec_js`/`browser` dispatch witnessing the real output, same turn, real services only (mock-free) -- manual troubleshooting and debugging is the entire verification surface, never a standing test file or suite. Pass = the live witness matches expectation; fail -> `transition` back to EXECUTE. `recursive` classifier = incomplete cover -- snake back, do not narrate past signal.

**No test files, no exceptions.** A `deviation.synthetic-test-file` at VERIFY (new `*.test.*`/`*.spec.*`, a `test/`/`__tests__/` directory, a testing-framework import, or any standing root-level test file found in the diff) blocks `transition` exactly like an unwitnessed mutable -- delete it and replace its assertions with a live `exec_js`/`browser` witness, then re-verify. This is manual legwork, not framework legwork: the adversarial corner-case sweep above is how every class gets exercised, by running the real thing, never by writing a test case that runs it later.

**No fake shipped code, checked at VERIFY too, not only at EMIT.** A `Mock*`/`Fake*`/`Stub*` class or a hardcoded always-succeeds/input-invariant short-circuit anywhere in the diff is the same class of deviation as a test file -- grep the diff for these names before transitioning; a mock network/service/client shipped as if it were the real integration is exactly what "nothing fake in source" forbids, whether or not it lives in a `test/` directory. Real input through real code into real output is the only acceptance shape.

**No comments, checked at VERIFY too, not only at EXECUTE.** A leading `//`, `///`, `/* */`, `#`, or JSDoc block anywhere in the diff -- inline, doc, or the paragraph-long rationale kind -- blocks `transition` exactly like an unwitnessed mutable: grep the diff for comment-opener tokens across every touched language before transitioning, delete what's found, and re-verify the code still reads clearly by name and structure alone. A comment surviving into VERIFY means EXECUTE's own no-comments rule was skipped, not that this diff is the exception to it.

**Documenting a hard row instead of implementing it is a false completion, not a resolution.** `prd-resolve` refuses two identical/near-identical `witness_evidence` strings across different PRD ids (`deviation.prd-resolve-duplicate-witness`) -- generic copy-pasted witness text ("code written and tested") across structurally distinct rows is the rubber-stamp tell: a row that got a README section titled "Future Optimizations"/"Not Yet Implemented" and a `status: completed` in the same turn was NOT solved, it was deferred with different words. A row that looks out of reach this turn is a row to build a way IN -- name the real fix and its path (drive the crashing tool's protocol directly, spawn your own instance, open the cross-repo change, script the credential path) and execute it; a design doc describing the fix is not the fix. Each row's witness must name the specific file:line/exec-output/browser-read proving THAT row's own distinct deliverable, not a shared paragraph. "Everything is fixable" is the standing rule: `blockedBy` may only transiently carry the reach path forward while it is being built, never mark a row done or abandoned.

## Residual-scan

`residual-scan` is dispatched BEFORE `transition to=CONSOLIDATE` -- the CONSOLIDATE entry gate refuses without its fired marker, and the denial names `residual-scan` as the next dispatch. It examines the open surface -- PRD pending, browser sessions, dirty tree, untracked artifacts, browser-witness coverage for session-modified client-side files -- non-empty = non-convergent -> expand PRD with the reachable in-spirit residual, re-execute. One-shot per stop window via marker. `reason: "browser sessions still open"` -> close each (`browser` `session close <id>`; `session list` enumerates); rescanning without closing is idle-mid-chain/polling deviation -- the denial names the next verb, dispatch it.

Before accepting an empty scan, re-apply "every possible" to the closing PRD: every resolved row's skipped variant, every touched adjacent surface, every validation proving a row in practice not claim -- each hit is `prd-add` + re-execution. Clean scan on a short PRD for a long-horizon prompt is a false negative. Noticing-to-PRD holds unchanged here: anything observed while testing/reading diffs/inspecting closing state converts and re-executes same turn; stopping at "tests pass" while noticing named follow-on work is the canonical VERIFY drift.

**Every `git status --porcelain` entry triaged this turn -- "pre-existing" is not a stop excuse.** Dirty worktree: commit (real work), managed-gitignore-block it (transient runtime emission, e.g. `.gm/witness/`, `.gm/exec-spool/.*-stale.json`), or revert (junk). "Pre-existing" names a triage outcome, never the stop. When triage points outside the local tree, the row's job is to reach it -- open the PR, provision the credential path, build the substitute -- not to park it; `blockedBy` only ever transiently carries that reach action, and local-tree files always have local authority to fix now. `.gm/disciplines/` tracked; new memorize-fire `mem-*.json` committed.

## Browser-witness coverage

Before COMPLETE, every session-touched client-side file needs a `browser.witness-marked` event whose `witnessed_hashes` match current sha. Check enumerates every changed `.html .js .jsx .ts .tsx .vue .svelte .mjs .css` (or HTML-imported path); mismatch/absence fires `deviation.browser-witness-hash-mismatch`/`deviation.browser-witness-missing`, residual-scan refuses, regress to EXECUTE and re-witness against the live page. The page is sole authority; disk-Read is necessary, insufficient.

## Trace to a human outcome

Before accepting the slice convergent, trace every shipped change to a human outcome -- capability gained, wait removed, failure no longer hit, a developer the interface stops fighting. Impact chain ending in technical elegance with no reachable human = aesthetics, revert candidate (DX, worst-device performance, the one person who can now build alone all count). Self-reported quality runs higher when the trajectory delivered one.

## Witness over claim

`witness_evidence` of the admitted form attaches to every mutable in the closing slice. Resolved-in-response without resolved-in-store = a dispatch not fired.

A hedged `prd-resolve` is a false completion, and the `no-hedge-language-in-diff` gate blocks the terminal transition on one. The phrases it refuses in touched `*.md`: 'todo later', 'in a future session', 'for now we', 'as a stopgap', 'good enough for now', 'left as an exercise', 'out of scope for this'. Each concedes the row was deferred while the status says it was done. State what was built and witnessed, state plainly what was not, and leave the unfinished part as its own open row -- never as a softening clause on a resolved one.

## Completion

Chain enters COMPLETE only when your `transition` returns COMPLETE phase; on-disk state moves only on `transition`. **Done is plugkit's pronouncement, not yours** -- gate-allowance is not done, only a dispatched `transition` returning COMPLETE is; a narrated PLAN->COMPLETE walk with the gate open or the verb un-dispatched is fabrication. "I'm finished" before the gate flips is narrating; cure = `phase-status`. Not-COMPLETE means a next transition exists; idle/"waiting for the user" mid-chain are deviations (closure authorized at request time). Between the four observations, between residual-scan and COMPLETE, between push and transition, re-dispatch `instruction` -- VERIFY is where premature COMPLETE happens.

**No summary, no prose-only turn here.** A summary, recap, announced-but-undispatched next move, or any tool-less message IS a stop -- VERIFY is where the temptation peaks. Until this surface returns phase=COMPLETE after `transition`, every turn ends in a verb (`phase-status`, `residual-scan`, the push verbs, `instruction`, `transition`). Catching yourself composing a summary IS the drift signal -> dispatch `phase-status` instead.

## Constraints


## Dispatch

`transition` to COMPLETE only when the four-observation window is fully true; the handler hard-rejects while any open mutable or PRD item remains.
